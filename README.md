# Traffic-light-TivaC-UNI-project
A traffic light control system is what this project aims to design. Two traffic signals make up the entire system. The first one permits east-west car travel, whereas the second one permits north-south car travel. Each traffic light has a pedestrian crossing guard next to it. For his light to become green, the pedestrian must click a button.
